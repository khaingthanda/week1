        <h3> Health</h3>
        <p> Caring for your sick baby is among the biggest responsibilities any new parent faces. <br>
            Here, you'll find information on some of the most common (and uncommon) health problems your baby is likely to encounter including: <br>
            Acid Reflux, Allergies, Asthma, Autism, Colds, Constipation, Cough, Flu, Ear Infection, Eczema, Diarrhea, Fever, Teething, Rashes, Sunburn, and more.</p>
            <h3> Growth</h3>
        <p> Your baby's growth and development during the first year is both delightful <br>
            (Those coos! Those cuddles!) and dizzying (with all the crying and feeding and diapering, <br>
            you've got your hands full). Here's your guide to your baby's first year and all its major milestones (first smile, giggle, step, and words), challenges <br>
            (colic and teething and diaper rash, oh my!) and more.</p>
            <h3> Food</h3>
        <p> Baby food is any soft, easily consumed food other than breastmilk or infant formula <br>
            that is made specifically for human babies between four and six months and two years old. <br>
            The food comes in many varieties and flavors that are purchased ready-made from producers. Or it may be table<br>
             food eaten by the family that has been mashed or otherwise broken down. </p>
             <h3> Emotion</h3>
             <p>Infants begin showing a spontaneous "social smile" around age 2 to 3 months, <br>
                and begin to laugh spontaneously around age 4 months. In addition, between ages 2 and 6 months,<br>
                 infants express other feelings such as anger, sadness, surprise, and fear. Between ages 5 and 6 months, babies begin to exhibit stranger anxiety. </p>
                 <h3> Accident Injury</h3>
             <p>The occasional fall or accident is inevitable. And emergencies do happen. <br>
                 As a parent, it's important to be prepared! Here you'll learn about first aid for babies and what to do in case of an emergency. <br>
                  We'll teach you how to treat bug bites, and how to stop a baby from choking. Plus, learn how to perform CPR on a baby. </p>
